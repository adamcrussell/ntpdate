1.0 What is ntpdate?
--------------------

ntpdate is a simple and small replacement written in Perl for the homonymous
and obsoleted tool from the ISC NTP package. ntpdate sets the local date and
time by polling the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the server
argument to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on the local
host.

For real time synchronization, please use a more professional software, for
example the already mentioned ISC NTP from http://ntp.isc.org/.


2.0 Requirements
----------------

- perl >= 5.6.0; with the following perl modules installed:
  - IO::Socket
  - Time::HiRes
  - POSIX
  - Getopt::Long
  - Sys::Syslog
- man >= 1.0p
  - man >= 1.5p is recommented to avoid possible problems
- vixie-cron >= 3.0.1
  - vixie-cron >= 4.1 without PAM support is recommented


3.0 Installation and configuration
----------------------------------

Extract the ntpdate-X.Y.Z.tar.gz using "tar xvfz <file>" or "gzip -d <file> &&
tar xvf <file>" for example. The "X.Y.Z" simply stands for the current version
number of ntpdate.

After that, change into the directory and type "make install" for installing.


4.0 License and copyright
-------------------------

The original script, where ntpdate is based on, was licensed under the same
terms as Perl itself. As far as I know, Perl is published under Artistic or GPL
license, so I used the GNU General Public License for ntpdate. And the complete 
license you can get at: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html


5.0 Some NTP information
------------------------

This program will not work after the NTP timestamp rollover on 02/07/2036.

Finally, RFC 2030 (ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2030.txt) recommends
the following on stratum usage: As the load on the hosts supporting NTP primary
(stratum 1) time service is heavy and always increasing, clients should avoid
using the primary servers whenever possible. In most cases the accuracy of the
NTP secondary (stratum 2) servers is only slightly degraded relative to the
primary servers and, as a group, the secondary servers may be just as reliable.


6.0 Bugs and reporting
----------------------

Please report bugs and problems - written in German or English language - to
me at: ntpdate@robert-scheck.de


7.0 Thanksgiving
----------------

I want to use this part of the README file to say "thank you" to Ralf D. Kloth
<ralf@qrq.de>, who wrote the base of this ntpdate program.
